  "Context": "Embedded applications need interaction with its users using input and outpout devices. Specifically input devices pose a challenge as users are much slower that computers and waiting for user input could slow down the application or make it unresponsive. In languages like C#, there is a possibility to control application flow using events. Using this in an embedded (arduino) environment would be a possible solution for this issue.",
